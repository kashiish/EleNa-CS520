# EleNa: Elevation-based Navigation (EDIT)
Navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. However, they do not consider elevation gain. Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are
looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.

The high-level goal of this project is to develop a software system that determines, given a start and an
end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, while limiting the total distance between
the two locations to x% of the shortest path.

# How to Run
## Backend
To use EleNa on your system, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of EleNa. This will get you all the needed Python dependencies for you have the project run locally. 

Then, simply run `python3 src/app.py` in the root directory. Now, you will be prompted to enter details of yours desired travel, such as start and end location, preferred routing algorithm, mode of transporation, etc.
