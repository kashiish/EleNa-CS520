# EleNa: Elevation-based Navigation (EDIT)
Navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. However, they do not consider elevation gain. Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are
looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.

The high-level goal of this project is to develop a software system that determines, given a start and an
end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, while limiting the total distance between
the two locations to x% of the shortest path.

# How to Run
## Backend
To use EleNa on your system, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of EleNa. This will get you all the needed Python dependencies for you to run the project locally. 

Then, simply run `python3 src/app.py` in the root directory. Now, you will be prompted to enter details of yours desired travel, such as start and end addresses, preferred routing algorithm, mode of transporation, etc. 

Note: The current version of EleNa uses Boulder, Colorado's map so only addresses in Boulder will work. We are using a cached version of the Boulder map that was downloaded on 11/8/2021. If you would like to download an updated copy of the map or use the map of a different city please run:

`python src/map.py <city> <state> <country>`  from the root directory.

## Python GUI

TODO

# How to Validate
We have written a series of tests for the Dijkstra and A* algorithms. To run the tests, run `pytest` in the root directory. 

**NOTE: This app has only been tested with Python3**
